# Mausam — Personalized Homepage Engine

**SIH 2026 · Problem Statement SIH26076**
Ministry of Earth Sciences / India Meteorological Department · Theme: Smart Automation

## Problem

The Mausam mobile application shows the same generic weather homepage to every user. A parent planning a school commute, a runner planning a morning workout, and a person with asthma all see the same cards in the same order — even when the most important information for each of them is completely different.

## Our Solution

A **contextual relevance and priority engine** that produces a personalized, ranked homepage for each user by combining:

- Real and simulated weather/environment signals (AQI, UV, rain probability, wind, sunrise/sunset, severe warnings)
- User persona and optional health flags
- Time-of-day context (commute window, daylight hours)

The same underlying weather data produces *different card orders and different alerts* for different users — transparently, with an audit trail showing exactly which signal values drove each ranking decision.

> **This is not a replacement Mausam weather app.**
> It is an intelligent personalization layer that sits between raw meteorological data and the app's homepage UI.

---

## Personalization Example

**Weather state:** AQI 165 (Poor) · UV 9 (Very High) · Rain 55% probability · No active warning

| Persona | Top Card | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Health-conscious (asthma) | **AQI Alert — P1** | AQI 165 × respiratory flag → 1.8× urgency threshold |
| Outdoor fitness | **UV Warning — P1** | UV 9 (Very High) + outdoor relevance → 1.8× urgency |
| Parent / family | **Rain Alert — P1** | 55% rain within commute window → high family relevance |

Same weather. Three genuinely different homepages.

## Supported Personas (Current MVP)

The current implementation deeply supports **three personas** with dedicated scoring weights, urgency bands, and card prioritization:

1. **Health-conscious users** — AQI, UV, pollen (simulated), humidity guidance
2. **Outdoor fitness enthusiasts** — activity window, sunrise/sunset, wind, heat alert, UV
3. **Parents & families** — rain commute alert, commute-window detection, severe warnings

> **Regarding the remaining official PS personas:**
> Beachgoers & surfers, Travelers, Agriculture & gardeners, Commuters (traffic), and Event planners were deliberately deferred to future expansion rounds (see [Decision D4](docs/planning/00_project_decision_log.md)). The engine architecture — one card definition + scoring rule per persona/signal — is designed so adding a new persona is a data/rule-table addition, not an architecture change.

**Cold-start:** a user with no preferences set gets an immediate, sensible, safety-first homepage (Severe Warning > General Conditions > AQI/UV at moderate default weight). No login or setup required.

## How It Works

```
Data Adapters (AQI, UV, Forecast, Warning, Sun)
    └─→ Context Assembly (ContextFrame per request)
           └─→ Personalization Engine [frozen, pure function]
                  └─→ Ranked Cards + Explanations
                         └─→ /homepage API
                                └─→ Frontend (renders returned order — never re-ranks)
```

The **frontend always renders the backend's card order**. Personalization logic lives exclusively in the engine — this is what makes the explanation layer auditable: every rank decision is traceable to the exact signal values that drove it.

```

> The engine (`engine/`) is a frozen pure function: `ContextFrame → (RankedCards, Explanations)`. It has no network or database calls. It is not modified during Phase 2A or 2B and will not be modified during frontend integration.

## Running the Project

### Backend

```bash
# From repo root
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment (see docs/planning/16_production_architecture_reassessment.md for full config)
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://..."    # Neon or local PostgreSQL DSN
$env:ADAPTER_MODE = "fixture"            # "fixture" (default) or "live"

# Run API
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                     # Starts Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

> The frontend currently renders the default Next.js boilerplate. The Mausam homepage UI is the next implementation milestone — see [docs/frontend_handoff.md](docs/frontend_handoff.md).

---

## Testing

```bash
# Engine tests (134 tests)
python -m pytest engine/tests -q

# Backend API tests (13 tests)
python -m pytest backend/tests -v

# Production boundary check (import guards + no secrets in production files)
python check_boundaries.py
```

## Roadmap

1. **[Next] Frontend personalized homepage** — S2: render ranked cards from `/homepage` API
2. **[Next] Preferences/persona UI** — S4: GET/PUT `/preferences`, live reorder on change
3. **[Next] Explanation sheet** — S3: render `/explain` response ("why is this shown?")
4. **[Near-term] End-to-end integration test** — full demo scenario from persona change to visible reorder
5. **[Future] Targeted persona expansion** — comfort index (event planners), marine fixture card (beachgoers), extended forecast shape
6. **[Future] Live adapter hardening** — AQI/UV timeouts, retries, parse guards (per `docs/planning/16_production_architecture_reassessment.md`)
7. **[Future] Production deployment** — Render (backend) + Neon (PostgreSQL)

## Team Handoff Notes

**Frontend developer →** See [docs/frontend_handoff.md](docs/frontend_handoff.md). The personalization engine is complete and running. You consume ranked API results — you do not implement any ranking logic in the UI.

**Presentation/PPT team →** The key innovation is: *same weather context, transparently different homepage for different users, with every decision traceable to real signal values.* Not ML. Not a persona template. A rule + scoring engine that makes the "why" visible. See [docs/planning/12_demo_and_judging_narrative.md](docs/planning/12_demo_and_judging_narrative.md) for the exact demo script and prepared judge Q&A.

**Engine team →** `engine/` is frozen. Do not modify. All changes go through adapter extensions or new card definitions — adding a card requires only an entry in `engine/cards.py`, `engine/scoring.py`, `engine/explain.py`, and a corresponding test.
